# focus-nau
a focus timer for productivity with a sprinkle of flair

why? I sure as hell need it!

# what I learned
too many animations and effects make you look like a bad powerpoint

countdown math isn't too bad

when the function isn't firing, most likely tried to task it with too much (i.e. smaller simple functions ensure success)

# things to do
get the mobile view in order

... maybe change the application points of the colors

implement a tally system / results screen to show total alloted time for a given activity (which will be my way to practice local storage)

# easter eggs

giant text reminiscent of Guilty Gear Strive's COUNTER

icon voicelines akin to Under Night in-Birth

EVA UNIT-01 colors, minus the black... should I put in black?
